# CamRaff - Milestone Project 4 - Art of Darts

![displays]()

Here is a link to my deployed site: []()

For my fourth and final project on my course with Code Institute via University Centre Peterborogh, I was tasked with creating a fully functional website that could be used as an e-commerce site, capable of allowing users to register and log in, save their details, search for and filter the items available, add to and view items in their bag, and finally complete their purchase. The site also requires superuser capability, allowing for store management and admin. 

I decided to create Art of Darts as a little bit of a passion project, as I have been a casual darts player myself for many years and having been witness to the massive blow up of darts following Luke Littler's success, I thought it would be fun to make something of my own relating to darts.
